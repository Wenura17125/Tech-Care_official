# User Dashboard Enhancement Plan - TechCare

## 1. Research & Analysis
The current User Dashboard provides basic overview, history, and device management. However, for a "Pro" experience, it needs deeper operational integration and better performance.

### Key Findings:
- **Performance**: Data fetching is parallelized but can be optimized with better caching and skeleton loaders (implemented).
- **Navigation**: Users currently have to navigate away for key actions like booking or deep support.
- **Engagement**: Missing real-time updates and proactive maintenance alerts.

## 2. Feature Roadmap

### A. Operations & Management
1.  **Integrated Booking Engine (Schedule Section)**:
    - Move from a separate route to an in-dashboard tab.
    - Support for selecting registered devices for faster booking.
    - Real-time availability check for technicians.
2.  **Advanced Device Vault**:
    - Service history per device.
    - Warranty tracking.
    - Automated maintenance alerts (e.g., "Time for a battery health check").
3.  **Repair Lifecycle Management**:
    - Granular status updates (Pickup -> Diagnostics -> Repair -> Testing -> Ready).
    - Digital invoice management with download support.
    - Direct technician chat integration (already partially there, needs better UI).

### B. User Experience (UX)
1.  **Unified Activity Feed**: A chronological list of all interactions (bookings, payments, messages).
2.  **Rewards & Loyalty**: Integration with the TechCare loyalty program (LKR rewards for completed repairs).
3.  **One-Click Support**: Instant access to help with context-aware ticketing.
